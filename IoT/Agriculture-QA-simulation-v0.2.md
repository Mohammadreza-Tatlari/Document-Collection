# Agriculture QA Simulation v0.2
## What to expect in this document.
After the 15 Interviews Simulation in [Agriculture-QA-simulation-v0.1](Agriculture-QA-simulation-v0.1.md) I have upgrade the questions in to more detailed ones and I will run that in to another 15 more interviews.

Questions are as follow:
* grouped by *what they actually uncover*
* plus **brief interviewer notes** (what the question is really testing)

You should **not ask all of them to every farmer**. Think of this as a menu.


#### Section A – Current behavior
Goal: **map the real decision loop**, not what they *think* they do.

1. Walk me through **your last irrigation from start to finish**.
2. How much notice do you usually have **before you irrigate**?
3. What usually **forces you to change** an irrigation plan?
4. Do you ever irrigate **earlier or later on purpose**? Why?
5. Who else is affected when you decide to irrigate?
6. What happens **before irrigation** that takes the most time?
7. What happens **after irrigation** that you still worry about?
8. How do you track **how much water was used**?
9. What information do you **wish you had** at the moment of decision?
10. What part of irrigation feels **routine vs stressful**?

**Interviewer note:**
If they can’t narrate step-by-step, their process is informal → automation risk is high.


#### Section B – Consequences of mistakes
Goal: **convert “mistakes” into economic and emotional pain**.
1. How quickly do you usually **notice** an irrigation mistake?
2. Who notices first—you or someone else?
3. Can a mistake be **fixed later**, or is it permanent?
4. Which mistake affects **this year only** vs **next year too**?
5. Have mistakes ever caused **conflict** (family, neighbors, buyers)?
6. What mistake keeps you awake at night during the season?
7. Have you ever **ignored a problem** because fixing it felt risky?
8. How do buyers react when irrigation affects quality?
9. Which mistake feels **embarrassing** vs just expensive?
10. If the same mistake happened again, what would you do differently?

**Interviewer note:**
Emotion (stress, shame, conflict) is often a stronger adoption driver than money.

#### Section C – Constraints
Goal: **surface immovable walls**, not “problems to solve”.
1. Which part of irrigation is **completely outside your control**?
2. What constraint has **gotten worse** in recent years?
3. What do officials think your constraints are—and where are they wrong?
4. What happens if **you break the rules** around water?
5. Who suffers first when water is limited?
6. What is the **most unreliable** part of your system?
7. What do you plan for—and what **cannot be planned**?
8. Which constraint would you remove **if you could remove only one**?
9. What constraint do outsiders **never understand**?
10. When things go wrong, what do you **blame first**?

**Interviewer note:**
If a constraint is political, legal, or social → tech alone cannot fix it.

#### Section D – Trust and authority
Goal: **understand influence channels and trust collapse points**.
1. Who do you call **before** making a risky decision?
2. Who do you call **after** something goes wrong?
3. Who benefits if you follow their advice?
4. Whose advice do you **never question**?
5. When was the last time you **changed your mind** based on advice?
6. What makes advice feel “real” to you?
7. Have you ever paid for advice? Was it worth it?
8. Do younger farmers trust the same people you do?
9. What kind of proof do you need before trying something new?
10. Who would you blame if a new system caused loss?

**Interviewer note:**
If blame always shifts to the advisor/system → adoption resistance will be high.


### Section E – Money (indirect)
Goal: **extract willingness to pay without asking directly**.
1. What expense surprised you most last season?
2. What cost feels unavoidable—even if it’s painful?
3. What do you delay paying for until the last moment?
4. What did you stop buying after one bad experience?
5. What do you consider a **“small” expense** vs a “big” one?
6. Have you ever paid more for reliability?
7. What expense saves you the most **time or stress**?
8. If income drops, what do you cut first?
9. Have you ever invested in something just to **sleep better**?
10. What kind of cost feels insulting, even if it’s cheap?

**Interviewer note:**
WTP is revealed by **what they tolerate paying for**, not what they claim.

#### Critical warning
**Do NOT add these types of questions yet:**
* “Would you use a system if…”
* “How much would you pay for…”
* “Do you want an app/device/dashboard…”
* “If we built X, would it help?”

Those belong **after** you identify:
* repeated pain
* constraint ownership
* decision authority

#### What you now have
You now have:
* ~75–80 interview-grade questions
* structured to extract **behavior, pain, limits, power, and money**
* without contaminating the interview with solution bias

### Scenario 2 - small wheat & barley farmer near Dezful
#### Background
I’m a **small wheat & barley farmer near Dezful (Khuzestan)**.
About **18 hectares**, surface irrigation from a canal, high heat, strong government involvement.

#### Section A – Current behavior

**1. Walk me through your last irrigation from start to finish.**
I checked the canal schedule, cleared debris from my inlet, opened the gate early morning, monitored flow for a few hours, then closed it before noon because heat spikes fast.

**2. How much notice do you usually have before you irrigate?**
Officially a week. In reality, **1–2 days**, sometimes same day.

**3. What usually forces you to change an irrigation plan?**
Canal flow changes or upstream farmers taking more than their share.

**4. Do you ever irrigate earlier or later on purpose? Why?**
Earlier, *yes—if I think water might be cut unexpectedly*.

Downstream farmers and my hired labor.

**6. What happens before irrigation that takes the most time?**
Physically checking the canal and negotiating with neighbors.

**7. What happens after irrigation that you still worry about?**
*Waterlogging in low areas.*

**8. How do you track how much water was used?**
*By gate opening time and experience—no meters*.

**9. What information do you wish you had at the moment of decision?**
*Reliable confirmation that water will continue flowing*.

**10. What part feels routine vs stressful?**
Opening gates is routine. Trusting the canal is stressful.


#### Section B – Consequences of mistakes

**1. How quickly do you notice an irrigation mistake?**
*Within **24–48 hours***.

Neighbors notice first if I overuse.

**3. Can a mistake be fixed later, or is it permanent?**
Some damage is permanent—especially during heading stage.

They downgrade grain, no discussion.

**9. Which mistake feels embarrassing vs just expensive?**
Embarrassing: neighbor complaints.
Expensive: yield loss.

**10. If it happened again, what would you do differently?**
Close water earlier, even if unsure.


#### Section C – Constraints

**1. Completely outside your control?**
Canal management.

**2. Constraint that got worse?**

This season—delayed irrigation after warning from upstream.

**6. What makes advice “real”?**
When it comes from someone controlling water.

**7. Paid for advice?**

#### Quick analytical note (for you, not the farmer):

This profile screams **“decision under threat of loss, not optimization.”**
Any solution framed as “efficiency” will be rejected unless it **reduces social and rule-based risk**.

#### Why Scenario 11 is strategically important

This farmer **cannot buy optimization**.

Any IoT pitch that:
- Requires subscriptions
- Assumes autonomous decision power
- Focuses on marginal yield gains </br>
→ **will fail here**.




If you want, next step (when you ask) we can:

* Compress these patterns into **decision archetypes**
* Or explicitly mark **which scenarios are MVP-eligible vs ecosystem-locked**
* Or map **IoT value vs crop/region** as you originally planned

Say the word when you’re ready to move on.





* Decompose these 11 scenarios into **buyer archetypes**
* Map **which scenarios are actually addressable in MVP v1**
* Or run **Scenario 12** (livestock + irrigation coupling)
**analyze cross-scenario patterns**
Decompose these 11 scenarios into **buyer archetypes**

Look for Questions that have "Sleep better"

Or explicitly mark which scenarios are MVP-eligible vs ecosystem-locked
Or map IoT value vs crop/region as you originally planned
