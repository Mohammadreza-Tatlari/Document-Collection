## Buyer and Decision Archtype based on Interview [Simulation.v0.2](Agriculture-QA-simulation-v0.2.md)
the following Archetype are based on Behavior, Constraints and risk logics.

### The Core Axis
1. Axis 1: Decision Control

Low ←────────────→ High
(shared water, power, labor) → (private well, private pump, autonomy)

2. Axis 2: Feedback Speed

Slow ←────────────→ Fast
(perennials, quality loss) → (daily crops, visible damage)

Archetypes form where these axes intersect.


### Archetype 1: The Risk-Buffering Operator
High responsibility, partial control, medium feedback.

#### Decision logic:
**“I can’t afford to be wrong.”**

Seen in Mixed-crop farmers, Pump + electricity dependency, and Semi-commercial farms. where Over-irrigates intentionally. Prefers early action. Avoids experiments. Sleeps badly during season

#### What matters
- Early warnings
- Confirmation, not optimization
- “Am I about to get in trouble?”

#### What breaks trust
- Systems that add decisions
- Anything that contradicts intuition without explanation

#### IoT value ceiling:
Moderate. Only if it reduces regret, not maximizes yield.



### Archetype 2: The Turn-Defensive Sharer
Low control, slow feedback

#### Decision logic:
**“If I lose my turn, I lose everything.”**

Seen in Canal users, Water-right conflicts, and Remote regions. where Irrigates when access appears, not when ideal. Prioritizes presence over precision and Negotiation has more weight than agronomy

#### What Matters:
- Notice of water availability
- Proof of fair usage
- Evidence in disputes

#### What breaks trust
- “Optimization” talk
- Systems that assume **autonomy**

#### IoT value ceiling
Low: if its going to be for a single farmer
High: if the system is establisehd in **coordination-layer**

Value emerges only if multiple parties are involved.



### Archetype 3: The Market-Pressured Optimizer 
High control, fast feedback

#### Decision logic
**“Quality today beats yield tomorrow.”**

Seen in Peri-urban vegetable growers, Market-linked farms, and Short-cycle crops. where Actively adjusts irrigation, Will pay for reliability, Tracks outcomes mentally

#### What Matters
- Timing aligned to harvest
- Weather + market signals
- Failure prevention

#### What breaks trust
- Slow systems
- Generic recommendations

#### IoT value ceiling
High: **Best early adopter if scoped narrowly.**



### Archetype 4: The Asset-Protection Farmer
