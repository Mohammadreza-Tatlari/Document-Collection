# cephadm OSD drive groups – one OSD per disk, device classes ssd/hdd
# Apply after bootstrap and host add. Adjust hostnames and devices to match disk-map.
# Ref: ceph orch apply osd -i osd-drivegroups.yaml (or add OSDs via CLI per device)

# Example: define drive groups per node (YAML format for cephadm may vary by version)
# Below is documentation; use `ceph orch device zap` and `ceph orch daemon add osd` per device if needed.

# Node2 example (replace with real devices from ceph orch device ls):
# - node2: /dev/sda (500G SSD), /dev/sdb (500G SSD), /dev/sdc (900G HDD)
# - node3: ...
# Device class is set when creating OSD or via: ceph osd crush set-device-class ssd <osd.id>

# Optional: use ceph-volume or cephadm drive group (Ceph Quincy+):
