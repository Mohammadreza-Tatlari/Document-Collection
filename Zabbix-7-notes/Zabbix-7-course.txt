https://sbcode.net/zabbix/install-provision-linux/

essential parts about zabbix-7 topic is about to be written followed by sbcode.net documentation.

### ### ###

### 2 - Download and Install The Zabbix Repository ###

following the manual of zabbix installation to install zabbix server
https://www.zabbix.com/download
note:
for package installation arm64 is mostly used on OS running on RasberryPi for instance.



### 3 - Create the Initial Database ###
we can use ` service (mysql/postgrsql) status ` or `systemctl status (mysql)` to check whether we have this programs installed on OS other wise we can install it from `mysql-server`

Setting the log_bin_trust_function_creators variable to 1 relaxes these restrictions:
It allows users to create functions even without the SUPER privilege.
It allows the creation of functions that are not DETERMINISTIC.
its disadvantage:
security issues  and replication issues. thats why after zabbix datastore creation it should be disabled again.

note:
use -v (verbose) in import initial schema and data to be sure that datastore is being created and monitor it.

for verification u can use:
• mysql > show databases; => to see database that is created for zabbix;

• mysql > use zabbix; => to switch to the zabbix datastore.
• mysql > show tables; => to see all tables

• mysql > select * from users; => to see all users

use ` systemctl status zabbix-server ` to check status of zabbix server and remember to enable it if it is not



### 4 - Log in and Configure Zabbix Server Front End ###

in zabbix-frontend wizard be careful, the first user & password that you are providing is the password that is related to user working in your database.

the default zabbix web server password is:
user: Admin
password: zabbix
note:
you can change password in zabbix dashboard Users > Users 



### 5 - Configure a Domain name for the Zabbix Server  ###
you can assign a domain name for your zabbix server (it can be your local DC NS :) )

you need to add a A record to your DNS provider and that A record should Point at your zabbix-server.



### 6 - Configure SSL for Zabbix Server Front end ###
you can use https://certbot.eff.org/ to configure local TLS and SSL connection over HTTP.

remember to select the current Web-server and operating server in which for ubuntu it is called "Linux (snapd)".

* note: for TLS you do need a Domain Name First.

for installation:
• sudo snap install --classic certbot



### 7 - Configure Firewall ###
for configuring firewall be sure that:
SSH 22/TCP is open for remote connection.
HTTP TCP/80 is open for HTTP and CertBot for revalidation of IP (optional)
HTTPS TCP/443 for secure HTTP connection.

Also it is best practice to create a Secure Tunnel connection to your zabbix server thus the only IP that can connect to your monitoring is only you.
you can also assign a range of IPs to the firewall.



### 8 - Overview So Far ###
always remember to make a Diagram about what you have done with details about each component of the project.
for instance:
the connection in webserver which consist of:
- zabbix-frontend on Port 433 , 80 TCP
- zabbix Server on Port 10051
- MySQL on Port 3306 which frontend and webserver are connected to.
- local zabbix agent on Port 10050 which is connected to zabbix-server via 127.0.0.1 (zabbix agent on web-server is used to give information about zabbix-server itself).

note:
zabbix server and zabbix agent version should match otherwise it can make problems.



### 9 - Install Zabbix Agent on Same Network as Zabbix Server ###
follow the zabbix agent installation on: 
https://www.zabbix.com/download?zabbix=7.2&os_distribution=ubuntu&os_version=24.04&components=agent_2&db=&ws=

in /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf, this parameters needs modification:
1. Server
2. ServerActive: if the 
3. Hostname : is the name that zabbix-server/zabbix-proxy is going to use to name the host.

- passive check on agent: it means that Zabbix-Server/proxy will send request to agent to retrieve data from it.
- active check on agent: it means that agent will send data automatically to zabbix server/proxy base on an interval timer.
thus:
if zabbix agent is on active check, the "ServerActive" parameter should be modified
if zabbix agent is on passive check, the "Server" parameter should be modified.

Adding a new host:
important parameters that are required for adding a Host:
- Host Name: it should match with the end-Host that data is being recieved.
- Templates: the OS and the Service that the Zabbix is retrieve data from it.
- Host Group: the Host should belong to a host Group for better organization and Consistency.
- Interface and Port: if it is a passive check by server (which it means that server sends request to agent) Ip address of the end host with and Protocol should be set.
- Monitored by:  If server or Proxy is retrieving data.

security purpose:
we can only allow zabbix-server to be able to have connection with port 10050 so it will be more secure. however this rules should be added at the end of project.



### 10 - Install Zabbix Agent Active on a Windows Host Behind a Firewall ###
CGNAT (Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation)
CGNAT is a network address translation (NAT) method used by internet service providers (ISPs) to share public IP addresses among multiple customers. thus it can not be a static IP so for that we can use an Active Agent to send data to the Static Based IP Of Zabbix-Server. also CGNAT will prevent hosts from port forwarding.

installation of Zabbix Agent Windows Wizard:
in Wizard,
- zabbix server IP/DNS : is the zabbix server in which the agent will connect to
- Server or Proxy active checks: for Active Proxy.

configuration caution:
- be sure that the ports are open for both sides and are not blocked by firewall.
so actually zabbix agent connect to server via port 10051
- if agent is active and it pushes data to server/proxy, in the server the interface is not required. (should be double checked!)
so simply if agent is on Active mode, it means that the port 10051 of zabbix-server or 10052 of zabbix-proxy should be open to it. and port 10050 is not required cause it is one way sending data. but if pasive is active so the 10050 should also be added cause in this case server will send request to 10050 of agent on end-host.
note:
the passive or active of agent will be demonstrate on host > items > Type.



### 11 - Install Zabbix Agent on CentOS on a different Cloud Provider ###



### 13 - Enable PSK (Pre-Shared Key) Encryption for Zabbix Agents ###
PSK is usually used for traffic that is passing through the public internet.
however, if your policy is that the local connections should also use PSK it is okay.

configuration:
- On end-host (linux):
	• openssl rand -hex 32: creates a 256 bit PSK secret on end-host
	• mkdir /home/zabbix/secrets/ => creating a directory to hold secrets
	• openssl rand -hex > secret.psk => creating a psk secret filewith openssl
	• chown zabbix:zabbix secret.psk => only zabbix user can read/write the file
	• chmod 640 secret.psk => changing premission to not let anymone to read it.
      -• /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent > TLSConnect=psk => enable psk TLS connection on agent.
	• /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent > TLSAccept=psk => agent will reject if data is not encrypted in PSK.
	• /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent > TLSPSKFile=/home/zabbix/secrets/secret.psk=> location where the psk is created
	• /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent > TLSPSKIdentity=Win-Terminal-Srv1 =>telling zabbix server/proxy which key name to use
	
- on zabbix-server
	• in Host > Encryption => add PSK and PSK check, add PSK Identity equal to end-host and create random openssl -hex 32 for PSK field.



### 14 - Creating Host Items ###
you can create a customized Item from Hosts and receive them only.
it can improve speed and bandwidth of the network by reducing more request packets.
also using template can cause so much overload over server so it is recommended to use Items creation.

Data Collection > Hosts > Items > Create Item(top button).
parameters:
• Type: the data that is coming from which protocol.
• Key: the parameters that needs to be monitored
• Type of Information:
	- Numeric (unsigned): it can be from 0 to infinite
	- Numeric (float): it can contain Negative Number
	- Character: data that contains text and char in it
	- Log: information that has format, like date 
	- text: log texts
	- 
• update Interval: the time that it will be requested or pushed.
• Timeout: it will consider the host to be unavailable.
• History: time of storing the data on database.
• value mapping: the customized value that will be shown in monitoring for parameters.
• Unit: it received values like "B" for byte or "%" for percentage , etc to show the information in that format 

Zabbix Agent Ping	Zabbix Agent (active)	agent.ping	
Free Space	Zabbix Agent (active)	vfs.fs.size[C:,free]	B
CPU (User)	Zabbix Agent (active)	system.cpu.util	%

note:
in Items, "Execute Now" Option is only available for Passive Items because it is the server that is requesting for value.



### 15 - Creating Host Triggers ###
triggers are used for re-evaluating a host when the parameter that is received from it is pased from specific expectation. for example the value is higher than the maximum threshold.

Data Collection > Hosts > Triggers > Create Trigger

Examples of time-based functions are nodata(), date(), dayofmonth(), dayofweek(), time(), now()

for example:
NODATA 60 seconds	Disaster		nodata(/host/agent.ping,60)=1
Less than 5GB free	High			last(/host/vfs.fs.size[/,free])<5000000000
High CPU Usage 75% for 2 minutes	Warning	avg(/host/system.cpu.util[,user],2m)>75

useful documents for creating trigger:
https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/triggers

trigger functions:
https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/appendix/functions



### 16 - Set up the Email Media Type ###
we can add email to zabbix for notifying admins. the mail server can be used for disaster alerts for instance.

• Alert > Media types > mail
however there are so many other ways that can be used to send notification
also template for email can be modified.

note: for email on SMTP protocol we need a mail server which most organization do provide.

you should also enable Alerting from Actions Section
Alerts > Actions > Trigger Action > enabling "Report problems to Zabbix administrators"

the Media Should be also enabled for each user after the Alert is added.
Users > Users > (select a User) > Media > Add.



### 17 - Creating Host Graphs ###
you can see each component graph for each host by going to:
data collection > hosts > click on Items > then click on 3 horizontal dots > and select Graph from the drop down menu.
you can also go to:
Monitoring > Latest data > (filter the Host) optional > and select the graph at the end of host name space.

side note:
for creating Items from each host to Monitor we can use cloning options which can be seen when we are in New Item Component Windows.

for creating a Graph:
Data collection > Hosts > Click on Graph > create a new Graph 

note:
you can also add Triggers to be shown on Graphs



### 18 - Convert Host Items Triggers and Graphs To A Template ###
we create template for triggers hosts and their items to make it easy to add new hosts base on similar parameters and goals.
tamplates are in:
Data Collection > Template 

we can also add hosts setup or items and graphs to a template by using "Copy" option in their tabs and copy them in to desired template.

remember that when a host is created and is up based by a template, the items or graphs cannot be edited unless the modification are done on template directly.



### 19 - Template Dashboards ###
you can create a template for dashboards and it is located in:
Data Collection > Templates > Dashboard Button

when a template for dashboard is created the data which is being demonstrate on each graph or visualization will be contain of place holders become that visualization is going to be used for hosts.

note:
some data like gauges or clock should not be persisted on database for more than 7 days because they can affect performance and long run issues.



### 20 - Global Dashboards ###
in the global dashboard we have three main components:
Global View: which is the main zabbix dashboard and its difference is that it can show data from multiple hosts.
Zabbix Server: which is consist of a diagram of Hosts and Nodes.
zabbix server health: which contain graph and visualization about zabbix server condition.



### 21 - Creating a Network Map ###
it is possible to create a Diagram/map of a network inside the zabbix and assign triggers to them to have a better visualization of network.
Monitoring > Maps > Create a New Map.

in map we can use macros to make Labels and Each node property as dynamic name for example using {Host.Name} for label of the zabbix node:
https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/appendix/macros/supported_by_location



### 22 - Reading Windows Event Logs ###
in windows OS logs are preserved in Event Viewer > Windows Logs and each section has its own logs.

these logs are holding are activities that are happening on the windows. so we can use them to monitor it on our zabbix server.
note:
be sure that the logs are logged on by Local system and not other accounts, to check it go to:
Services > ( service Name) > properties > Log On. and it should be on Local System account to be send by Agent to Zabbix Server/Proxy

to create an Item for Event logs it is recommended to add that Item to a Template:
Data Collection > Templates > Items > create Item.
example of a Failed Login Item:
	Important Properties:
		it needs to be an Active check to receive logs from Events
		Key value can be: eventlog(Security,,,<eventid>,,<mode>)
			- security indicated the section which it belongs
			- eventid relates to ID number which it is in SystemLog
			- the action that happens for logs (ie: skip; which only checks when there is new event logs)
			- Type of inofmation is Log

### 23 - Item Preprocessing with Regex ###
https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/items/preprocessing

pre-processing means to add something to the data before monitoring it.
for instance when we receive log data from a host it might include some useless information inside that too. so we need a way to filter it out in order to not fill our database with useless information.

for instance we can use regex to filter out the data that is being collected from log files.
for that we can use:
https://regex101.com/

for instance we do regex on Failed Login logs:
Account Name:\t\t(.*)  \1=> it will filter out the whole text and only shows the lines which have "Account Name" in it and if there is 2 output similar it will show the second one.

to imply the preprocessing step, we should go do:
Templates > Items > (Open or create an Item) > preprocessing tab.
and add the regex parameters in to parameters tab and also add the output (\1 or \0) to it.



### 24 - Item Preprocessing with JavaScript ###
it is also possible to do preprocessing with JS similar to regex but keep in mind that in zabbix v7 the javascript version that is supported is ES5 so variables like const and let are not allowed.

for instance:
var lines = value.split('\n')
var lineZero = lines[0]
var accountName = ''
lines.forEach(function (line) {
  if (line.trim().substring(0, 13) === 'Account Name:') {
    accountName = line.substring(14).trim()
  }
})
return accountName + ' : ' + lineZero

https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/items/preprocessing/javascript



### 25 - Remote HTTP monitoring using Web Scenarios ###
we can monitor a website if that website is in range of our host or it also can be out of zabbix domain. but remember that this web check actually happens by zabbix server or proxy itself and not by agent so it means that request to fetch data will be sent from the zabbix server to that website. however it is also possible to send the data as a pretender.

to do so:
template > (desired host) > web > create new scenario.
scenario and steps 

it is possible to add query parameters and status checks for query parameters.

to check out web, in latest data filter out "scenario".

https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/web_monitoring/example



### 26 - JSON API Monitoring with the HTTP Agent Item ###
we can do JSON API operation by Zabbix. for instance GET data from a website API and monitor it on zabbix server. it is also possible to do POST or PUT request on API too.
it also doesn't matter which host is request the API because it is the Server/Proxy which is request that API call.

to add API based Item:
Template > Items > create Item > Type: HTTP Agent. (items can be filled based on request and json format).

also it is possible to do preprocessing on JSON values for that we can used:
https://jsonpath.com/
JSON Path Examples:
https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/items/preprocessing/jsonpath_functionality

to test preprocessing value first we need to check "Get Value from host" and then add the fetch data after JSONPath implimentation.

note:
when we do pre-processing we also can changed the format of items to desired way cause we have already filtered out the outcome.

it is also possible to used direct URL instead of filtering out with JSONPath.

if HTTP request has authentication it should be consider to add that in Item's value which is "HTTP authentication" and based on security it can be vary.



### 27 - Log File Monitoring ApacheNginx HTTP Status Codes ###
Monitoring Log files - HTTP status COdes of an Apache or Nginx web server.
* we can adapt this feature to monitor production webserver.

there are some steps to be able to read logs from web-servers on devices.
firstly we are trying the access log on zabbix-server itself.

to monitor logs from these services (ie: nginx):
1. we should first located the log files that are on Linux, which are usually in:
/var/log/(nginx/apache2)/

2. we need access.log file but we need to be sure whether zabbix have access to it or not.
to do so:
• ls -lh => to see which groups have access to the files.
• groups zabbix/zabbix agent => to check which group zabbix is belonged to.
• usermod -a -G (adm) zabbix => adding zabbix to the group that has access to log files.
• sudo -H -u zabbix bash -c 'tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log' => we commit a tail command as zabbix user to be sure that zabbix has access to log file.

3. then we need to use regex expression in order to filter out the data that is being received for the nginx log file.
we can use regex101 website 
example of a regex being used:
^(\S+) (\S+) (\S+) \[([\w:\/]+\s[+\-]\d{4})\] \"(\S+)\s?(\S+)?\s?(\S+)?\" (\d{3}|-) (\d+|-)\s?\"?([^\"]*)\"?\s?\"?([^\"]*)\" => this regex file also have escape quotations in order to be used in HTTP agent Items in zabbix. ( " " ) remember to use double quote.
note:
in regex we have defined groups so in we can use \8 for <output> to should 8th group. so it means only status codes.

4. then we need to add a new Item in zabbix template with the Type: Zabbix agent (active). the key need to be " log[]:  Log file monitoring "

5. add trigger base on status error of 404 in order to check whether the web service is being under pen testing or etc.
	5.1 go to triggers
		• Item : zabbix HTTP Nginx (or whather it is selected that receives status of web server)
		• Last of (T): based on 1min Time
		• V (value): 404
		• Result: >= 10
		• OK event generation: None (in order to not be closed if status is changed on next logs)
		• allow manual close.



### 28 - Dependent Items ###
Creating dependent items means that the agent doesn't need to run possibly identical queries on a host many times in order to extract parts of a value. The master item runs once on the host, and then the Zabbix server/proxy updates the dependent items each time the master item is updated.

dependent Items can be used for situation in which there is a Item that consist of lost of information and Regex riched or the resource for data processing of it is on high demand.

to do so, similar to creating an access.log for nginx we can make it as a master item and assing dependent Items to it:
Master:
	name: HTTP Access Log
	Type: zabbix Agent (active)
	Key: log[var/log/nginx/access.log,"^.*",,,skip,,,,]
	type of Information: Log
Dependent Item:
	• Name: HTTP Web Server Status
	• Type: Dependent Item
	• Key: HTTPStatusCode
	• Type: Numeric
	• Master Item: HTTP Access Log
		Preprocessing:
			Regular Expression: ^(\S+) (\S+) (\S+) \[([\w:\/]+\s[+\-]\d{4})\] \"(\S+)\s?(\S+)?\s?(\S+)?\" (\d{3}|-) (\d+|-)\s?\"?([^\"]*)\"?\s?\"?([^\"]*)\"    output: \8	

it is also recommended to create a separate dashboard for dependent Items:
	• create a dashboard with the name and add dependent Items to that.
	note: the created dashboard can be access from; Hosts > Dashboards > (select name of the dashboard from top bar).
